# SiPM-Analysis

## RootReader
the original RootReader: https://github.com/Uni2K/RootReader \
modified RootReader by Andrea: https://github.com/andi-matter/bachelor/tree/andrea \
modified RootReader-macros by Alex: https://github.com/AlexVagts/wavecatcher-analysis (he did not really tidy up his repository) \
I kept all important Macros and changes from Alex/Andrea and I will try to document them here

## wavecatcher-analysis (analysis_programm)
the original wavecatcher-analysis: https://github.com/cscharf-hub/wavecatcher-analysis \
Since the wavecatcher-analysis's main Script, the "ReadRun.cc", gets updated constantly (and I contribute to that), I will try to keep it up to date here. More important are the Macros i used to analyse the data.

## General infos
(I am copying bits and pieces from before mentioned repositories for this)
