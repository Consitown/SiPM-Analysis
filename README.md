# SiPM-Analysis
SiPM = silicon photomultiplier

## RootReader
the original RootReader: https://github.com/Uni2K/RootReader \
modified RootReader by Andrea: https://github.com/andi-matter/bachelor/tree/andrea \
modified RootReader-scripts by Alex: https://github.com/AlexVagts/wavecatcher-analysis (he did not really tidy up his repository) \
I kept all important Macros and changes from Alex/Andrea and I will try to document them here

## wavecatcher-analysis (analysis_programm)
the original wavecatcher-analysis: https://github.com/cscharf-hub/wavecatcher-analysis \
Since the wavecatcher-analysis's main Script, the "ReadRun.cc", gets updated constantly (and I contribute to that), I will try to keep it up to date here. More important are the Macros I used to analyse the data.

## General infos
(I am copying bits and pieces from before mentioned repositories for this, but also give some infos myself) \
If I speak of a Macro, I mean a file that one executes in the terminal. \
If I speak of a Scripts, I mean a file that is used by a macro (all Scripts are .cpp or .cc or .C - files)
### some background for context
I used the here presented software to analyse data generated by SiPM-arrays which are placed on PCB's (Printed Circuit Board). These SiPM's have the task to collect light giuded by polymethylmethacryate (PMMA) tubes/cylinders. The light is produced by liquid-szintillator (LS) and the wavelength of the produced light is shifted by the coating on the PMMA tubes/cylinders (so called WOM-tubes; wavelength shifting optical modules). The shifted wavelength yields the highest quantum effeciency for the used SiPM's. The LS (consists of LAB+PPO) is confined inside a steel box and the PMMA tubes/cylinders are emerged into the LS within a PMMA vessel (it's like a pot). These steel boxes are part of the planned SHiP (search for hidden particles) project. In particular the boxes are to be used as the surround background tagger (SBT, basically a massive veto detector). See this pdf for some more infos on the SHiP-projects: https://www.physik.uni-hamburg.de/iexp/gruppe-hagner/pdf/bick-dpg-2017-online.pdf (the SBT is the large, gray, increasing in thickness when going to the right thing on page 21)
### Taking data
The eMUSIC Miniboard v2 by Scientifica (http://siub.ub.edu/down/music/emusic-miniboard.user_guide.r2.5a.pdf) is in charge of collecting the electric signals from the SiPM's. These signals are then digitalized using a WaveCatcher from Caen (https://www.caen.it/products/wavecatcher/) and recorded via the piece of software that accompanies the WaveCatcher. I usually save only the waveforms of the recorded events (enough for all analysis purposes). These waveforms are stored in .bin-files
